You probably have a folder somewhere with meeting recordings. Maybe you transcribe them. Maybe your platform does it automatically. You have the text. You never read it again.

Every one of those transcripts contains something a communication coach would pay to see: exactly how you behave when the conversation gets difficult, when you are under pressure to close, when someone pushes back on your idea. The data is sitting there. Nobody looks at it.

## The hour nobody accounts for

The average knowledge worker spends four to six hours in meetings every week. Many of those meetings are recorded. A growing number are automatically transcribed. The transcription sits in the meeting notes, gets shared in the team channel, and is never opened again.

This is not a discipline problem. It is a tooling problem. You have raw text but no framework for turning it into feedback. Reading your own transcript and trying to extract insight is slow, uncomfortable, and subjective. You see what you want to see. The patterns you most need to catch are exactly the ones you are most likely to rationalize away.

Structured analysis removes the subjectivity. Instead of reading and feeling, you measure and compare.

## What the data actually shows

Most people have two or three communication habits that quietly cost them in meetings. The problem is that these habits are invisible to the person who has them.

**Speaking balance** is the most common surprise. You know intellectually that listening is important. You do not know that you spoke for 72 percent of your last one-on-one. The optimal range for that meeting type is 40 to 55 percent. You were 32 points over. Your counterpart spent most of the meeting waiting for a gap to speak.

**Hedging language** is the second. Under pressure -- when someone challenges your proposal, when you are not certain of a number, when the conversation gets tense -- most people fall back on softeners. "I think," "maybe," "sort of," "I'm not sure but." Five or six instances in a 30-minute call is normal. Twelve is a pattern. Seventeen means the other person heard nothing as a firm position.

**Filler word density** is the third, and the most measurable. The number of "um," "like," "you know," "basically" you produce per minute of meeting time is a direct signal of cognitive load. Spikes happen at topic transitions and under pushback. The baseline is more revealing than any single instance.

**Active listening signals** are what people think they have more of than they do. Paraphrasing, clarifying questions that reference what was just said, building on someone else's point before adding your own: these are countable behaviors. Most professionals produce two or three per hour-long meeting. The benchmark for a coaching conversation is six or more.

**Facilitation outcomes** are the last category. Did the meeting end with a named action owner and a date? Or with "we'll figure it out"? This one correlates directly with whether decisions made in the room actually get executed.

## A score is a starting point, not a verdict

The Communication Effectiveness Index (CEI) is a composite score from zero to one hundred. It weights the five categories based on their impact on meeting outcomes and communication quality. Excellent means 85 or above. Needs Work means below 55.

The score is not the point. The score is a handle. Something you can track, compare, share with a coach without having to explain the methodology every time.

What matters is the category breakdown. A CEI of 68 with low active listening looks completely different from a CEI of 68 with high filler word density. The intervention is different. The trajectory is different. The score alone tells you where you are. The category breakdown tells you what to do next.

## The dashboard as communication artifact

One thing that changes when you move from "I read my transcript" to "I have a structured analysis with a dashboard" is who you can involve in the feedback loop.

A 30-minute transcript is not something you share with your manager or coach before a conversation. An interactive HTML chart showing your CEI across the last six meetings is. A radar chart that shows you score 82 on facilitation and 44 on conflict avoidance takes three seconds to understand.

This is not about performance management. It is about making the feedback conversation faster and more concrete. Instead of "I felt like I talked too much in that negotiation," you have "Speaking Balance: 68% me, 32% counterpart, against a target of under 40% for negotiation meetings." That sentence ends the guesswork and starts the coaching.

## Tracking change over time

A single analysis is useful. A trend line is actionable.

The first time you see your CEI, you have a baseline. The fifth time, you can see whether the intervention you tried in month two actually moved the needle. The tenth time, you have evidence of improvement that does not depend on memory or self-report.

This matters because communication change is slow. You will not feel the difference after two meetings. You will not notice that your filler word rate dropped from 1.8 to 0.9 per minute because it happened across fifteen conversations over six weeks. A longitudinal log catches what your memory cannot.

## What to do with the first analysis

Run it on a transcript you already have. Not your best meeting. A normal one.

Look at the CEI first, then go straight to the category with the lowest score. Read the timestamped examples for that category. They show you the exact moment the pattern occurred, the words used, why it created friction, and what a different response might have looked like.

Pick one thing. One pattern. One meeting type where it shows up most. That is the work for the next two weeks. The next analysis will tell you whether it moved.

The transcript is already there. The data was always there. Now there is a way to read it.
