Every business plan has blind spots. The founder who wrote it is too close to see them. The team that reviewed it shares the same assumptions. The advisor who blessed it spent 20 minutes on it.

The result? Plans that look solid on paper but collapse at the first hard question from an investor, a board member, or reality.

What if you could stress-test your plan *before* any of that happens?

## The Problem with Feedback

Traditional feedback has three issues:

1. **People are nice.** Your colleagues, mentors, and even paid consultants soften their criticism. Nobody wants to be the one who says "this won't work."

2. **People are busy.** A thorough review of a business plan takes hours. Most reviewers skim the executive summary and give surface-level feedback.

3. **People share your biases.** If your advisor is in the same industry, they likely share the same assumptions you do. The blind spots remain blind.

## AI as a Sparring Partner

An AI critic doesn't have these limitations. It's not trying to be polite. It doesn't get tired. And when properly instructed, it can systematically attack your plan from angles you never considered.

But here's the key: **a generic AI won't do this well.** If you ask ChatGPT or Claude to "review my business plan," you'll get a polite summary with mild suggestions. That's useless.

What you need is an AI that's been specifically trained to be *adversarial*. One that finds the weak spots, challenges the assumptions, and asks the uncomfortable questions.

## A Framework for Stress-Testing

Here's a practical approach to stress-testing any business plan, strategy document, or investment proposal:

### Round 1: Assumption Mapping

List every assumption your plan makes. Market size. Customer willingness to pay. Team capacity. Timeline. Cost projections. Technology feasibility.

Then challenge each one: "What if this assumption is wrong by 50%? Does the plan still work?"

### Round 2: Competitor Simulation

Imagine your strongest competitor reads your plan tomorrow. What would they do? How would they respond? What advantage do they have that you're underestimating?

### Round 3: Stakeholder Perspectives

Review your plan through the eyes of different stakeholders:

- **The skeptical CFO**: "Where's the ROI? What are the unit economics?"
- **The risk-averse board member**: "What's the downside scenario?"
- **The impatient investor**: "Why will this work *now* and not three years ago?"

### Round 4: Second-Order Effects

Your plan assumes that if A happens, B follows. But what else happens when A happens? What are the side effects, the ripple effects, the unintended consequences?

## Using Janus for Automated Stress-Testing

Running through all four rounds manually is exhausting. Janus is a skill that automates this entire process. It takes your document and systematically applies critical analysis frameworks. It finds logical inconsistencies, challenges unsupported claims, and generates adversarial questions.

The output isn't a gentle review. It's a structured stress test with severity ratings, specific evidence from your document, and actionable recommendations.

Think of it as hiring a brutally honest consultant who reads every line and charges nothing.

## When to Stress-Test

Don't wait until the plan is "final." Run a stress test:

- After the first complete draft (to catch structural issues early)
- Before any presentation to stakeholders
- After major pivots or strategy changes
- When you feel too confident (that's usually when blind spots are biggest)

The best plans aren't the ones that avoid criticism. They're the ones that have already absorbed it.
