Last September, a colleague told me his daughter had narrowed her high school choice down to two options: one because her best friend was going there, and the other because the building looked modern at the open day. She was choosing a path that would shape the next five years based on a friendship and an architectural impression.

This isn't unusual. In Italy, families face two critical education decisions with almost no structured support. The first comes at age 13, when students leaving scuola media must choose between licei, istituti tecnici, and istituti professionali. The second comes at 18, after the maturita, when the options expand to universities, ITS programs, or entering the workforce directly. Both decisions carry weight that compounds over a decade. Both are typically made with terrible tools.

## What families actually use to decide

Open days. The school puts on its best performance, shows the renovated lab, brings out the enthusiastic teachers, and serves snacks. It's a marketing event disguised as orientation. You learn what the school wants you to know, not what you need to know.

Word of mouth. The neighbor's son went to liceo scientifico and he's doing well. The colleague's daughter went to the ITS and got hired immediately. Useful data points, but they're sample sizes of one, applied to a completely different person.

Free online tests. "You're creative!" says the test after fifteen questions. No connection to actual school types. No employment data. No actionable pathway. Just a label and a pat on the back.

School counselors. Many are dedicated professionals doing difficult work. They're also managing 300-400 students with limited time per family. Fifteen minutes of guidance for a decision that spans a decade.

Private orientation consultants. Good ones exist. They charge 80-200 EUR per session, and you typically need two or three sessions for a proper assessment. Total cost: 240-600 EUR. Many families simply can't afford it.

## What career psychologists actually use

The gap between how families choose and how professionals assess is enormous. Vocational psychologists don't ask "what do you want to be when you grow up?" They measure interests, aptitudes, and working styles across standardized dimensions, then match those patterns against educational pathways.

The most widely used framework is RIASEC, developed by John Holland. It maps a person across six dimensions: Realistic (hands-on, practical), Investigative (analytical, scientific), Artistic (creative, expressive), Social (helping, teaching), Enterprising (leading, persuading), and Conventional (organizing, systematic). A 30-item assessment produces a profile that's far more useful than "you're creative" because it shows relative strengths and combinations.

A student who scores high on Investigative and Conventional might thrive in data science or accounting. One who scores high on Artistic and Social might find their place in teaching, communication, or design. The profile doesn't predict a career. It maps a landscape of possibilities that fit the person's actual wiring.

Italian career psychologists then map these profiles onto the specific school types available. This mapping is where the real value lies, because the Italian system has options that don't exist elsewhere. An istituto tecnico economico is not the same as a liceo delle scienze umane, even though both might appeal to a "social" profile. The differences in curriculum, pace, practical exposure, and future pathways are substantial.

## The employment data nobody shows families

Here's what makes the Italian education decision particularly consequential: employment outcomes vary dramatically by pathway. Almalaurea, the consortium that tracks university graduates, publishes detailed data on employment rates, salary ranges, and time-to-hire by faculty and institution. Excelsior surveys track workforce demand by sector and qualification.

The data tells stories that contradict popular assumptions. Some "prestigious" faculties produce graduates who struggle for years. Some ITS programs have placement rates above 80% within twelve months. Engineering has different outcomes than architecture, which has different outcomes than psychology, and the differences are not small.

This data exists. It's public. Almost no family consults it during the decision process. Partly because they don't know it exists. Partly because navigating raw employment statistics requires context that most families don't have. Knowing that "85% of ITS graduates in mechatronics find employment within 12 months" is useful only if you know what mechatronics is and whether it fits your child's profile.

## The dream problem

Every orientation process encounters the student who wants to become a professional footballer, an astronaut, or an influencer. The typical response falls into two categories: dismissal ("be realistic") or false encouragement ("follow your dreams!"). Both are wrong.

The useful approach is to take the aspiration seriously as data about the student. A teenager who wants to be an influencer might actually be scoring high on Enterprising and Artistic dimensions. The interest isn't the career title. The interest is in creating content, building audiences, and communicating persuasively. Those skills map onto marketing, communications, media production, and half a dozen other pathways that offer stable employment.

The goal isn't to kill the dream. It's to understand what the dream is actually made of, show the real data about that specific path, and identify adjacent pathways that preserve the core interest while offering realistic career prospects.

## The access gap

The tools and methodology exist. RIASEC assessments, Italian pathway mapping, employment data, structured orientation protocols. Professional career counselors use them every day. The problem is access. A thorough orientation process costs hundreds of euros and takes weeks. Families who need it most often can't afford it.

SchoolPath AI packages the complete professional methodology into a single skill: a 30-item RIASEC assessment calibrated for two age groups, full mapping to Italian school types aligned with MIM 2023 guidelines, Almalaurea and Excelsior employment data, and a Dream vs Reality protocol that takes aspirations seriously while showing real numbers. One session, one evening, 29 EUR. The same framework that costs 200+ EUR per session with a private consultant, available to any family with Claude Code.
