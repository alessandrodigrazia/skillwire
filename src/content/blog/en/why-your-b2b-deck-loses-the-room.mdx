I watched a sales team present to a buying committee of five people last year. The deck was 22 slides. Polished design, clean data, solid product. By slide eight, the CFO was on his phone. By slide twelve, the VP of Engineering had started a side conversation with the IT director. The presenter kept going. The deal stalled for three months after that meeting.

The deck wasn't bad. It was built for everyone and optimized for no one.

## The generic deck trap

Most B2B presentations follow the same formula: company overview, product features, case studies, pricing, next steps. This structure is easy to build and impossible to target. It puts the same content in front of a CFO who needs financial justification and a CIO who needs technical architecture.

The result is predictable. Financial stakeholders sit through technical slides they don't care about. Technical stakeholders sit through business justification they consider someone else's problem. Everyone gets 60% relevant content and 40% noise. The 40% is when they check email.

The problem compounds in enterprise sales where buying committees have three to seven members. Each member evaluates the proposal through their own lens. The CFO asks "What's the payback period?" The CIO asks "How does this integrate with our stack?" The CEO asks "How does this align with where we're going in three years?" Same product. Three completely different conversations.

## Structure before content

The first decision in building a presentation isn't what to say. It's what format to use. Four structures cover the vast majority of B2B scenarios.

**Executive presentations** run 10-15 slides and target C-suite decision makers. They lead with strategic impact, present financial evidence in the middle, and close with a decision framework. No feature lists. No architecture diagrams. The CEO doesn't care how it works. The CEO cares what changes.

**Operational presentations** run 15-25 slides and target technical evaluators. They open with the problem from a technical perspective, walk through architecture and integration, address security and compliance, and close with implementation timeline. No ROI waterfalls. No market positioning. The CIO cares about feasibility, not vision.

**Sales conversations** run 6-10 slides for discovery and qualification meetings. They're designed to be interactive: problem statement, exploration questions, initial solution hypothesis, proof points, next steps. Less presenting, more dialogue.

**Executive summaries** compress everything into 3-5 slides for board updates or time-constrained meetings. Every slide carries maximum information density. No warm-up.

Picking the right structure before writing a single slide saves hours and prevents the "generic deck for everyone" problem.

## Narrative: the invisible architecture

Structure tells you what goes on each slide. Narrative tells you why those slides are in that order and how they connect. A deck without narrative structure is a collection of facts. A deck with narrative structure is an argument.

Three narrative frameworks handle different selling situations.

**Raskin's 5-Step** is the clearest: status quo (where the buyer is now), problem (what's wrong with the status quo), solution (your approach), proof (evidence it works), next steps (what happens if they agree). This works when the buyer already knows they have a problem and is evaluating solutions.

**Dunford's 8-Step** works when you need to position against alternatives. It starts with market context, establishes what "good" looks like, maps competitive alternatives and their tradeoffs, then positions your solution as the best fit for this specific buyer's situation. Use this when there are three vendors in the room and you need to differentiate.

**Challenger's 6-Step** works when the buyer doesn't yet realize they have a problem. You teach them something new about their business (the "commercial insight"), reframe how they see their situation, show the cost of inaction, present your approach as the logical response, prove it works, and propose next steps. This is the hardest to execute but the most powerful when the buyer is happy with the status quo.

Choosing the wrong narrative framework is like telling a joke with the punchline first. The content might be good. The impact is gone.

## The persona problem

A slide that says "Reduce operational costs by 30%" means three different things to three different people. The CFO hears "improve margin by 2 points." The CIO hears "cut my infrastructure budget." The CEO hears "free up capital for the transformation program."

Same number. Three different implications. A well-targeted deck acknowledges this by framing every data point in the language of the person reading it.

For the CFO: payback period, TCO comparison, impact on EBITDA, risk-adjusted ROI. Financial language, financial metrics, financial framing.

For the CIO: integration architecture, security posture, migration path, operational burden. Technical language, technical diagrams, technical risk assessment.

For the CEO: strategic alignment, competitive advantage, market positioning, transformation enablement. Vision language, market context, long-term trajectory.

Building three versions from scratch is impractical. Building one generic version and hoping each person finds their relevant slides is how deals stall.

The middle path: build once with persona tags. Mark each section as CFO-relevant, CIO-relevant, or CEO-relevant. Then generate persona-specific versions by pulling only the tagged content. Same source material. Different outputs. Minutes of work instead of days.

## QA: the step everyone skips

You built the deck. The structure is solid. The narrative flows. You're ready to present. Almost.

The last step most people skip is reviewing each slide for argument strength. Not grammar or formatting. Argument strength.

Three questions per slide: Is the claim on this slide supported by evidence? Is the evidence specific enough to be credible? Is this slide relevant to the person who will see it?

A slide that claims "Industry-leading performance" with no benchmark data fails question two. A slide about API architecture in a CFO deck fails question three. A slide that says "Our customers love us" with no specific case study fails question one.

This takes fifteen minutes and prevents the moment when a skeptical stakeholder asks "What evidence do you have for that?" and you don't have an answer.

## Building this into your workflow

B2B Presentation Builder handles the entire process. You provide the deal context, the target persona, and your content. The skill selects the right structural framework, overlays the narrative approach, adapts every section for the target stakeholder, and runs a three-level QA pass on every slide.

At 79 euros, it replaces the two days you currently spend building each major presentation from scratch. And unlike a PowerPoint template that gives you colors and layouts, it gives you the thinking: what goes where, what story to tell, and what makes each slide strong or weak.
