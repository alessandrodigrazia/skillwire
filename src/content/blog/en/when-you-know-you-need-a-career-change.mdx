You've been thinking about it for months. Maybe longer. Something at work doesn't fit anymore. The role that excited you three years ago now feels like a routine you're sleepwalking through.

You're not alone. Studies consistently show that 60-70% of professionals experience significant career dissatisfaction at least once during their working lives. The difference between those who navigate it well and those who spend years stuck? Structure. Not motivation, not courage. Structure.

## The problem with most career advice

Search "career change" online and you'll find two types of content. The first is inspirational: someone who quit their corporate job to become a yoga instructor and has never been happier. Great for them. Statistically irrelevant for you.

The second is generic frameworks: "discover your passion," "identify your strengths," "network with people in your target field." These aren't wrong. They're just too vague to be useful when you're sitting at your desk at 3 PM on a Tuesday wondering if you should update your resume.

Free personality tests are even worse. Most of them have no psychometric validation. They tell you you're an "ENTJ" or a "blue personality" and leave you with a label instead of a direction.

## Three types of career dissatisfaction

Career coaching research identifies three distinct patterns. Knowing which one you're in changes everything about what you should do next.

**You're in the right company, wrong role.** The culture fits. The people are good. The values align. You just hate what you do every day. This is the Job Crafting scenario: redesign the tasks, relationships, and meaning of your current position without changing employers. It's the least disruptive path and works more often than people expect.

**You need to move.** The role, the company, or the industry no longer fits who you've become. This is Career Transition territory. The critical step here is distinguishing between "push" motivation (running away from something bad) and "pull" motivation (running toward something better). Push decisions tend to land you in the same situation with a different logo. Pull decisions tend to stick.

**You've achieved everything and feel nothing.** This is the most confusing one. You hit your targets. Your salary is good. People respect your work. And you feel empty. Purpose Discovery addresses this, and it requires different tools than the other two: Career Anchors to identify your deep motivators, Ikigai assessments to find where your values, skills, market demand, and sense of contribution overlap.

## What validated assessments actually tell you

A real career assessment uses instruments that have been tested on thousands of people and published in peer-reviewed journals. The difference matters.

PERMA measures five dimensions of wellbeing: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment. When your "Meaning" score is a 3 and your "Accomplishment" score is a 9, that gap tells a story no personality quiz can surface.

Career Anchors (Schein's COI) uses 40 items to identify your core career motivators. Most people are surprised by the results. The manager who thinks she values general management discovers her real anchor is Autonomy. The engineer who thinks he wants to lead people finds his anchor is Technical Competence. These misalignments explain years of dissatisfaction that no amount of career articles would have diagnosed.

UWES-9 measures work engagement across three dimensions: Vigor, Dedication, Absorption. Low Vigor with high Dedication means you care about the work but it's draining you. High Absorption with low Dedication means you're busy but disengaged. Each pattern points to a different intervention.

## The safety question nobody mentions

Here's something most career advice skips entirely: sometimes what feels like career dissatisfaction is actually depression. Or burnout. Or anxiety. The symptoms overlap more than you'd think.

A responsible coaching program screens for this. PHQ-9 measures depression severity. GAD-7 measures anxiety. BAT-12 differentiates burnout from clinical depression. When scores reach clinical thresholds, the right response is to pause coaching and connect with a mental health professional. Coaching can help, but coaching alone won't be enough.

This isn't a nice-to-have. It's an ethical boundary that separates professional coaching programs from self-help content.

## Getting started without spending €1,600

A qualified human career coach charges €100-200 per session. Eight sessions means €800-1,600. For many professionals in career transition, that investment is hard to justify, especially when you're not even sure what you need yet.

Vera is an 8-session career coaching program that runs inside Claude Code. It uses the same validated instruments (PERMA, Career Anchors, UWES-9, Ikigai-9) and includes the safety protocols (PHQ-9/GAD-7) that a professional program would use. After an intake assessment, it routes you to the right branch: Job Crafting, Career Transition, or Purpose Discovery. Each session builds on the previous one, with micro-experiments and concrete deliverables.

At €49, it costs less than a single session with a human coach. The tradeoff is the human relationship. For some people, that matters deeply. For others, the structure and the assessments are what they really needed.

If you've been going in circles for months, start with Vera. If the assessments reveal you need deeper support, you'll know that too. Either way, you'll have data instead of guesswork.
