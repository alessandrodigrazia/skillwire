A recruiter at a mid-size tech company told me she receives 340 applications for a single senior role. She reads about 15. The other 325 never appear on her screen. An ATS filters them out before she starts her morning coffee.

The system isn't random. It follows rules. And most applicants break those rules without knowing they exist.

## The six-second window

Before ATS enters the picture, there's a simpler problem. When a recruiter does open your CV, you get six seconds. Research from TheLadders tracked recruiter eye movements and found that the average initial scan lasts 6-7.4 seconds. In that window, the recruiter decides: read further or move on.

What gets scanned in those seconds: current title, current company, start and end dates, education. Not your carefully crafted summary paragraph. Not your skills section. The structural information at the top. If those four data points don't match the role, the CV goes to the bottom of the pile.

## How ATS actually works

Applicant Tracking Systems parse your document into structured data. They extract your name, contact info, work history, education, and skills. Then they compare the extracted text against the job description's requirements.

The comparison is keyword-based. If the job description says "project management" and your CV says "PM" or "managed projects," the system might miss the match. If the job requires "Python" and you list it under a creative header like "My Toolkit," the parser might not categorize it as a skill.

Three things kill applications at the ATS stage.

**Wrong file format.** Some ATS systems can't parse multi-column layouts, tables, headers/footers, or images. Your beautifully designed CV with a sidebar and infographic skills section gets parsed into gibberish. The system extracts half your work history and none of your skills.

**Missing keywords.** Every job description contains specific terms the ATS looks for. "Agile methodology," "stakeholder management," "P&L responsibility." If those exact phrases don't appear in your CV, you score low on the match. Using synonyms sometimes works. Sometimes it doesn't. The safest approach: mirror the job description's language.

**Generic content.** "Responsible for managing team activities and driving results" contains zero specific keywords. It could apply to any role in any industry. ATS scores it poorly because it matches everything and nothing. Compare: "Led 8-person engineering team delivering cloud migration project, reducing infrastructure costs by 34%." Same experience, completely different signal.

## The customization problem

Here's where most job seekers get stuck. They know they should customize their CV for each role. They also know they're applying to 10-20 positions at once. Rewriting a CV properly for a single role takes two to three hours: reading the job description, identifying key requirements, reorganizing experience, rewriting bullets to match, checking ATS compatibility. Multiply that by fifteen applications and you've spent a full work week on CVs alone.

So people compromise. They send the same CV everywhere with maybe a different objective line at the top. The CV is good enough for none of the roles and perfect for none of them. The ATS filter catches the mismatch. Silence follows.

Professional CV writers charge 200-500 EUR for a single rewrite. They do good work. But they produce one version for one role, and the turnaround is a week. By the time you get it back, three of the five positions you wanted to apply for have closed.

## Job-fit: the number nobody calculates

Before spending hours on an application, there's a question worth answering: does this role actually match your profile?

Head hunters calculate this instinctively. They look at your CV and the job description and estimate the overlap: 80%? 60%? 40%? Above 75%, they'll submit your profile. Below 50%, they won't waste the client's time.

Most candidates skip this step entirely. They see a job title that sounds right, skim the description, and apply. Two weeks later they get rejected because the role required five years of experience with a specific technology they've used for six months.

A structured fit analysis saves time on both sides. It forces you to look honestly at where you match and where you don't. If you're at 45%, you either need to bridge specific gaps or find a closer match. If you're at 85%, you know exactly which parts of your experience to emphasize.

## The interview preparation gap

Getting past the ATS is only the first gate. Behavioral interviews are the second, and most candidates prepare for them the same way: they don't.

The STAR framework (Situation, Task, Action, Result) has been the standard for behavioral interviews for decades. Companies like Amazon, Google, and most large enterprises use it explicitly. The interviewer asks "Tell me about a time when..." and expects a structured narrative with a specific situation, your role in it, the actions you took, and the measurable results.

The problem is that people know the framework but don't prepare specific stories in advance. They walk in with vague intentions to "talk about that project" and end up rambling through a five-minute answer that never reaches a clear result. A prepared STAR story takes 90 seconds and lands with impact.

The preparation should include likely questions mapped to the role (a sales position will get different questions than an engineering one), red flags in your CV that the interviewer will probably probe (employment gaps, short tenures, lateral moves), and a closing pitch that leaves a memorable impression.

## Building this into your workflow

CV Guru automates the complete sequence. You provide your CV and a job description. The skill scores your current ATS compatibility, calculates job-fit percentage, rewrites the CV for that specific role, builds STAR stories from your actual experience, generates an interview briefing with likely questions, and packages everything into a ready-to-send DOCX.

The whole process takes fifteen minutes instead of three hours. And because it runs inside Claude Code, you can do it for every single application without the cost multiplying.

At 19 EUR for unlimited rewrites, it's less than the fee for a single paragraph from a professional CV writer.
