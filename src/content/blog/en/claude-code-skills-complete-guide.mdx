If you've been using Claude Code for a while, you've probably noticed something: it's incredibly capable out of the box, but it doesn't *know* your domain. It doesn't understand your company's sales methodology, your preferred writing style, or how your n8n workflows should be structured.

That's where **skills** come in.

## What Is a Claude Code Skill?

A skill is a structured package of files that transforms Claude from a general-purpose assistant into a **domain expert**. Think of it as giving Claude a specialization. The same way a doctor specializes in cardiology or a lawyer specializes in M&A.

Technically, a skill is a folder containing:

- A `SKILL.md` file (the main instruction set)
- Supporting files: templates, examples, validation rules, reference data
- Subfolders for different aspects of the skill

When you install a skill, Claude reads these files as instructions and instantly becomes proficient in that domain.

## Why Skills Matter

Without skills, every conversation starts from zero. You explain your context, your preferences, your methodology. Every single time. With skills, Claude already knows:

- **Your workflow.** The exact steps, tools, and sequence you follow.
- **Your standards.** What "good output" looks like in your domain.
- **Your terminology.** Industry jargon, internal naming conventions.
- **Your constraints.** What to avoid, what to prioritize.

The difference is dramatic. A generic Claude response might give you a decent first draft. A skilled Claude response gives you something you can actually use.

## How to Install a Skill

Installation takes 30 seconds, regardless of the platform.

### Claude Code (CLI)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
cp -r ~/Downloads/skill-folder ~/.claude/skills/

# Windows
xcopy %USERPROFILE%\Downloads\skill-folder %USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\ /E /I
```

### Claude Desktop / claude.ai

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Features** > **Skills**
3. Click **Add**
4. Upload the skill ZIP file (contains the main folder with SKILL.md and subfolders)

That's it. No restart needed. Claude picks up the skill immediately.

## What Makes a Good Skill?

Not all skills are created equal. A professional skill should have:

- **Clear scope.** It solves a specific problem, not everything.
- **Rich context.** Enough examples and templates to guide output quality.
- **Validation rules.** Criteria for Claude to self-check its work.
- **Versioning.** A version number and changelog so you know what changed.

The skills on Skillwire are designed by professionals who use them daily. Each one has been refined through hundreds of real-world interactions.

## Getting Started

If you're new to skills, start with a single skill that matches your primary workflow. Use it for a week. You'll quickly see the difference between generic AI assistance and domain-specific AI expertise.
