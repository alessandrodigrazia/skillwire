You can spot AI-written text from a mile away. The overly polished sentences. The lists of three. The "In today's fast-paced world..." openings. The relentless positivity. The complete absence of personality.

If you're using AI to write, your readers can tell. LinkedIn posts, emails, reports. Doesn't matter. Once they notice, they stop trusting what you say.

Here's how to fix that.

## Why AI Text Sounds Like AI

Large language models are trained on patterns. They learn what "good writing" looks like statistically and then produce the most probable next token. The result is text that's technically correct but emotionally flat.

Common tells:

- **Hedging everywhere.** "It's important to note that..." or "One might argue..." Nobody talks like this.
- **Perfect structure.** Every paragraph has exactly the same rhythm. Real writing is messy.
- **No personality.** No humor, no frustration, no real opinion. Just diplomatic nothing.
- **Buzzword density.** "Leverage", "synergy", "cutting-edge", "game-changer". Kill them all.
- **Transition abuse.** "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally" in every paragraph. Your reader isn't stupid, they can follow your logic without a traffic cop.

## The Humanization Framework

Making AI text sound human isn't about adding typos or broken grammar. It's about reintroducing the elements that make writing feel like it came from a person.

### 1. Start with Your Voice, Not AI's

Before asking AI to write anything, define your voice. Are you direct or diplomatic? Do you use humor? Do you curse occasionally? What words do you *never* use?

Feed these constraints to your AI. "Write like someone who's been in B2B sales for 15 years and is slightly impatient with buzzwords" produces very different output than "write a professional LinkedIn post."

### 2. Break the Perfect Structure

AI loves symmetry. Three bullet points. Three paragraphs of equal length. Three examples.

Real writing is messier. After generating, deliberately break the pattern. Make one paragraph a single sentence. Merge two bullet points into a run-on thought. Delete the conclusion if it doesn't add anything.

### 3. Add Specificity

AI speaks in abstractions. Humans speak in specifics. Replace "many companies struggle with this" with "I watched a €2M deal die last Tuesday because the proposal had zero ROI numbers."

The more specific, the more human.

### 4. Insert Your Actual Opinions

AI is diplomatically neutral. You're not. After generating a draft, ask yourself: "Do I actually believe this?" If not, rewrite the parts that feel generic.

A good trick: add a sentence that starts with "Honestly..." or "The truth is..." It forces you to state a real position.

### 5. Read It Out Loud

If you wouldn't say it in a conversation, don't write it. This single test eliminates 80% of AI tells.

## The Lazy Way

If this sounds like a lot of work, there's a shortcut. HumanWriter is a skill that automates this entire framework. It takes your AI-generated draft, runs it against 200+ known AI patterns, and rewrites it in a voice profile that matches *your* writing style.

Same framework as above, applied systematically by a second AI pass with your voice constraints baked in.

The result: content that started as AI but finishes as you.
